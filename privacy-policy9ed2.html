<p>
In compliance with the European Union legislation, we inform you that our website will store
some information about your preferences on your own computer inside a tiny file called a ‘cookie’.<br>
A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or
mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over
time.<br><br>
You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to
prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some
preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.<br><br>
Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete
them whenever they like. A third-party website called <a rel="noopener" href="https://aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank"><strong>aboutcookies.org </strong></a> has been set up to help
you with instructions on how you can do that on various browsers.<br><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold">We use cookies to:</span><br>
1) Identify you as a returning user and to count your visits in our traffic statistics analysis;<br>
2) remember your custom display preferences;<br>
3) Suggest any recent searches you’ve made on our site<br>
4) Other usability features including tracking whether you’ve already given your consent to
cookies<br>
Enabling cookies from our website is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will
provide you with a better browsing experience.<br><br>
The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully
under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.
There may also be other types of cookies created after you’ve visited our website. We use
<a rel="noopener" href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision" target="_blank"><strong>Google Analytics</strong></a>, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics
uses cookies to help us to analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the
cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and
stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the
purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and
providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer
this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties
process the information on Google’s behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP address
with any other data held by Google.<br><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold">Third-Party Advertising</span><br>
We may have third-party advertising companies serving ads to you when you visit our website.
These companies may store information about your visits to our website and to other websites in
order to provide you with relevant advertisements about goods and services.<br><br>
These companies may employ cookies and other identifiers to gather information which
measures advertising effectiveness. The information is generally not personally identifiable
unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or an
e-mail message.<br><br>
Information Gathered by Third Party Advertisers
Cookies enable advertisers to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions
you take on our site and other sites. This allows advertisers to provide you with more useful and
relevant ads. For example, if they know what ads you are shown while visiting our site, they can
be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. They do not associate your interaction with
unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.<br><br>
We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third-party sites. Advertisers and
other third parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers
they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content
are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, readers in the Pacific
Northwest who read certain types of articles). Also, some third-party cookies may provide them
with information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic
information) from offline and online sources that they may use to provide you more relevant and
useful advertising.<br><br>
If you would like to learn more about what options you have about limiting the gathering of
information by third-party ad networks, you can consult the website of the Network Advertising
Initiative.<br><br>
You can opt-out of participating in interest-based advertising networks but opting out does not
mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the companies from which
you opted out will no longer customize ads based on your interests and web usage patterns using
cookie-based technology.<br><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold">Type and Purpose of Collection </span><br>
We collect information at various points in the Website to facilitate its use by our customers.
Non-Personal Information: Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will
be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location
data (which is anonymous) and the referring website (“Non-Personal Information”). We use
Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the
Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified. For example,
we use “cookies”, which contains only certain statistical information. You can instruct your
computer to inform you whenever a cookie is being sent, or you can disallow cookies through
your web browser. If you do choose to disallow cookies, your experience on the Website may be
diminished, or your ability to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited.<br><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold">Sharing Information</span><br>
We will not sell, rent or disclose to outside parties the information we collect, save and except
that we may share the collected information with other parties as follows:<br><br>
(a) Affiliated Service Providers: We have agreements with various affiliated service providers to
facilitate the functioning of the Website, with whom we may share the information we have
collected. For example, we may share your credit card information with the credit card service
provider to process your purchase. All administrative service providers that we use are required
to have the same level of privacy protection as we have, and therefore we expect that your
information will be handled with the same level of care that we employ. Additionally, for
example, we may use analytic or marketing services such as Google Analytics, Google Adsense,
Taboola, or RevContent, to which collection you hereby unconditionally consent.<br><br>
(b) Where required by law: We may share the collected information where required by law,
specifically in response to a demand from government authorities where such demand meets the
legal requirements.<br><br>
(c) Statistical Analysis: We may share Non-Personal Information and aggregated information
with third parties, including but not limited to for advertising or marketing purposes. No Personal
Information will be shared in this manner.<br><br>
(d) Transactions: In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be
disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.<br><br>
